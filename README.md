# Void-linux-scripts
This is just a collection of automation scripts I'll use in Void Linux, which as of now, is my favourite distro. I plan to fill it up with so much, that I'll be able to daisy chain the scripts, making my own custom complete install script. (With my stuff, of course). I know nobody should care about this. :D
